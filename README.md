_Tanuki_ is a tiny web app that allows you to take media rich notes
(text, images, HTML, audio, video, embeds, etc.) and keep them
organized in your browser. I made it for taking personal notes to be
kept offline&mdash;a modern [commonplace
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).

It's meant to be a small bit of (nearly serverless) code that's easy
to understand and maintain.  At this point it's probably best for
programmers (or curious folks) to run on their local machines. It
doesn't require a network connection or try to put your data online,
but there's nothing preventing you from doing that sort of stuff
either.

It's made of [Python](https://python.org),
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/),
and some [Bower](http://bower.io/) components like
[Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/). I've also integrated
[frag2text](https://github.com/siznax/frag2text/),
[code-prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify), and of
course you can _embed_ anything you like from the web. I have
thousands of entries in my offline _tanuki_ and use it constantly.

Anyone can contribute to tanuki development and I'm happy to answer
any questions about it or hear feedback.
