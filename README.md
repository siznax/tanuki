_Tanuki_ is a tiny web app that allows you to take media rich notes
(text, images, HTML, audio, video, embeds, etc.) and keep them
organized in your browser. I made it for taking personal notes to be
kept offline&mdash;a modern [commonplace
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). 

It's meant to be a small bit of code that's easy to understand and
maintain. So, at this point it's best for programmers (or curious
folks) to run on their local machines. It doesn't require a network
connection or try to put your data online, but there's nothing
preventing you from doing that sort of stuff either.

It's made of [Python](https://python.org),
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/), 
and some [Bower](http://bower.io/) components like
[Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/). I've also integrated a
couple of enhancements like
[galleryjs](https://github.com/siznax/galleryjs) and 
[frag2text](https://github.com/siznax/frag2text/). 

I have well thousands of entries in my offline _tanuki_ and use it 
constantly. Anyone can contribute to tanuki development and I'm happy
to answer any questions about it or hear feedback.
