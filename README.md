_Tanuki_ is a web app that allows you to take media rich notes (HTML,
audio, video, etc.) in your browser. I made it for taking personal
notes kept offline. It's meant to be a small bit of code that's easy
to maintain. So, at this point _tanuki_ is really only suitable
for programmers (or curious folks) to run on their local machines, but
anyone can try taking some notes in the demo at
[tanuki.siznax.net](http://tanuki.siznax.net/).

I have over a thousand entries in my (local) _tanuki_ and use it
everyday. I hope others find it useful too. Anyone is welcome to
contribute. I'd be happy to answer any questions about it. See
<tt>[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/siznax/tanuki/blob/master/INSTALL.md)</tt>
to get started.
