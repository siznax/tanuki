_Tanuki_ is a web app that allows you to take media rich notes (HTML,
audio, video, etc.) in your browser. I made it for taking personal
notes kept offline, but it could easily be deployed as a weblog too.

Though I've been developing _tanuki_ for some time, it's really only
suitable for programmers (or curious folks) at this point, but anyone
can try taking some notes in the [demo](http://tanuki.siznax.net/). I
have over a thousand entries in my offline version and use it
everyday. 

I hope others find it useful, and anyone is welcome to contribute. I'd
be happy to answer any questions about what it is, or how it
works. See <tt>INSTALL.md</tt> to get started.
