_Tanuki_ is a web app that allows you to take media rich notes (HTML,
audio, video, etc.) in your browser. I made it for taking personal
notes kept offline. It's meant to be a small bit of code that's easy
to maintain. So, at this point _tanuki_ is really only suitable
for programmers (or curious folks) to run on their local machines, but
anyone can try taking some notes in the demo at
[tanuki.siznax.net](http://tanuki.siznax.net/).

What's it made of? 
[Python](https://python.org),
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/),
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/),
and [Bower](http://bower.io/) components like
[Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/).

I have well over a thousand entries in my (local) _tanuki_ and use it 
everyday. Everyone is welcome to collaborate on tanuki development. I'd
be happy to answer any questions about it. See 
<tt>[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/siznax/tanuki/blob/master/INSTALL.md)</tt>
to get started.
